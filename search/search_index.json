The model follows GO-CAM best practices for representing signaling receptor pathways and has good evidence support. While the model could be expanded to include additional branches and regulatory mechanisms, it effectively captures the core signaling events from insulin binding to MAPK activation.</p> <p>The model is suitable for production use and provides valuable information about insulin receptor signaling. With the suggested improvements, it could become an even more comprehensive resource for understanding insulin signaling pathways.</p>"}]}
