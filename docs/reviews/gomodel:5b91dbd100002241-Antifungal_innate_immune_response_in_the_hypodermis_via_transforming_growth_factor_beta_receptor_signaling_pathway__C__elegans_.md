I need a specific GO-CAM model ID to review for you. The model ID is usually in the format of "go.model:someUUID" or a local file path if you're working with a model that hasn't been published yet.

Could you please provide the exact model ID you'd like me to review? For example:
- A GO-CAM model ID like "go.model:5c50e699-0000-4000-a000-3c145d124604"
- Or a local file path if available
