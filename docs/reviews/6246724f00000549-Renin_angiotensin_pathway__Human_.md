# GO-CAM Model Review: Renin-angiotensin pathway (Human)

## Model ID: gomodel:6246724f00000549

### Overview

This GO-CAM model represents the renin-angiotensin pathway in humans, which is a key regulatory system for blood pressure and fluid balance. The model captures the core components of the pathway, focusing on the key enzymes and receptors involved in the conversion of angiotensinogen to active angiotensin II and the downstream signaling through the angiotensin type I receptor.

### Components Included

The model includes four principal activities:

1. **ACE (Angiotensin-converting enzyme)** - P12821
   - Molecular function: peptidyl-dipeptidase activity (GO:0008241)
   - Occurs in: extracellular space (GO:0005615)
   - Part of: angiotensin maturation (GO:0002003)

2. **Renin** - P00797-1
   - Molecular function: aspartic-type endopeptidase activity (GO:0004190)
   - Occurs in: extracellular space (GO:0005615)
   - Part of: angiotensin maturation (GO:0002003)

3. **Angiotensinogen** - P01019
   - Molecular function: hormone activity (GO:0005179)
   - Occurs in: extracellular space (GO:0005615)
   - Part of: maintenance of blood vessel diameter homeostasis by renin-angiotensin (GO:0002034)

4. **Angiotensin II receptor type 1** - P30556
   - Molecular function: angiotensin type I receptor activity (GO:0001596)
   - Occurs in: plasma membrane (GO:0005886)
   - Part of: angiotensin-activated signaling pathway (GO:0038166)

### Causal Relations

The model captures the following causal relationships:
- Renin directly positively regulates ACE (RO:0002629)
- ACE directly positively regulates Angiotensinogen (RO:0002304)
- Angiotensinogen directly positively regulates Angiotensin II receptor type 1 (RO:0002629)

### Evidence

The model cites appropriate evidence from peer-reviewed literature:
- PMID:32079768, 30639100 - Support for angiotensin II receptor type 1 activity
- PMID:1567413 - Support for angiotensin-activated signaling pathway
- PMID:1378723 - Support for the cellular location of AGTR1
- PMID:11432860, 1320019 - Support for ACE activity
- PMID:11274151 - Support for ACE cellular location
- PMID:12045255 - Support for Renin activity
- PMID:4300938 - Support for Angiotensinogen location

### Assessment

#### Biological Accuracy

The model correctly represents the core features of the renin-angiotensin pathway:
- Renin cleaves angiotensinogen to produce angiotensin I
- ACE converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II
- Angiotensin II activates the angiotensin II type 1 receptor

The causal relationships are correctly directional, representing the sequential enzymatic conversions and receptor activation.

#### Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices

1. **Molecular Functions**: Each protein is appropriately annotated with its molecular function (enzyme activity/receptor activity).

2. **Cellular Context**: All activities are appropriately contextualized with cellular component terms.

3. **Biological Process**: Each activity is correctly associated with the biological process it contributes to.

4. **Causal Relationships**: The model uses the appropriate causal relation predicates:
   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for enzyme-substrate relationships
   - RO:0002304 (causally upstream of, positive effect) for regulatory relationships

5. **Evidence**: Each annotation and relationship is supported by appropriate evidence codes and literature citations.

#### Potential Improvements

1. **Signaling Receptor Annotation**: According to the "Signaling receptor activity annotation guidelines", the angiotensin II receptor (AGTR1) should have as input the downstream effector it regulates, not the ligand itself. The current model shows the angiotensinogen as directly regulating AGTR1, which isn't fully compliant with the guidelines that specify the receptor should have as input the effector protein it regulates.

2. **Completeness**: The model could be expanded to include:
   - ACE2 and its role in converting angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7)
   - The AGTR2 receptor and its signaling
   - The downstream effectors of AGTR1 signaling (e.g., G-proteins, MAP kinases)
   - Additional biological processes regulated by the renin-angiotensin system

3. **Details of Enzymatic Conversions**: The model could more explicitly represent the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I by renin, and the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by ACE.

### Conclusion

The GO-CAM model for the renin-angiotensin pathway (gomodel:6246724f00000549) is scientifically accurate and largely follows GO-CAM best practices. The model captures the key components and relationships of the pathway, supported by appropriate evidence.

The main recommendation for improvement is to properly represent the input of the angiotensin II receptor according to signaling receptor annotation guidelines, and potentially to expand the model to include additional components and processes of the renin-angiotensin system for a more comprehensive representation.
