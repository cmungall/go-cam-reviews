I'll help you review a GO-CAM model, but I need the specific model ID to look up. The "{model.id}" placeholder needs to be replaced with an actual model identifier.

Model IDs typically look like UUID strings (e.g., "8a844cd8-1a2b-4d76-a4d2-875d76a3c67f") or may use a specific format like "gomodel:12345".

Could you please provide the complete model ID that you'd like me to review?
