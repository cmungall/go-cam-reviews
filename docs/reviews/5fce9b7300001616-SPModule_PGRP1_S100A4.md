# Review of GO-CAM Model gomodel:5fce9b7300001616 (SPModule-PGRP1-S100A4)

## Overview

This model describes a chemotactic signaling pathway in humans (Homo sapiens) involving PGLYRP1 (also known as Tag7), S100A4 (also known as Mts1), and the chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR3. The core of the model represents how the PGLYRP1-S100A4 complex functions as a chemoattractant that induces lymphocyte migration through activation of the CCR5 and CXCR3 receptors.

## Model Components

The model contains four main molecular activities:

1. **O75594 (PGLYRP1)** - enables molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) occurring in extracellular space (GO:0005615)
2. **P26447 (S100A4)** - enables chemoattractant activity (GO:0042056) occurring in extracellular space (GO:0005615)
3. **P49682 (CXCR3)** - enables C-C chemokine receptor activity (GO:0016493) occurring on cell surface (GO:0009986)
4. **P51681 (CCR5)** - enables C-C chemokine receptor activity (GO:0016493) occurring on cell surface (GO:0009986)

## Causal Relationships

The model includes the following causal relationships:
- PGLYRP1's molecular adaptor activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) S100A4's chemoattractant activity
- S100A4's chemoattractant activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) CCR5's C-C chemokine receptor activity
- S100A4's chemoattractant activity directly positively regulates (RO:0002629) CXCR3's C-C chemokine receptor activity

## Evidence Base

The model is supported by multiple experimental papers, primarily:
- PMID:26654597 - Shows the formation of the Tag7-Mts1 complex and its role in lymphocyte migration
- PMID:30713770 - Demonstrates that Tag7-Mts1 complex induces lymphocyte migration via CCR5 and CXCR3 receptors
- Other PMIDs supporting specific activities of individual proteins

## Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Biological accuracy**: The model correctly represents a novel chemotactic pathway that has been experimentally validated. The literature supports that PGLYRP1 (Tag7) forms a complex with S100A4 (Mts1) that can induce lymphocyte migration through CCR5 and CXCR3.

2. **Evidence-based**: Each activity and relationship in the model is supported by published evidence with appropriate ECO codes.

3. **Cellular context**: The model appropriately places the activities in their correct cellular compartments (extracellular space for the secreted proteins and cell surface for the receptors).

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Molecular Function Accuracy**: While CXCR3 is annotated with "C-C chemokine receptor activity" (GO:0016493), it should more accurately be annotated with "C-X-C chemokine receptor activity" (GO:0016494) since CXCR3 is a CXC-type receptor, not a CC-type receptor.

2. **Missing Activity Flow**: The model doesn't capture what happens downstream of the receptor activation. According to the literature (PMID:30713770), receptor activation leads to G-protein signaling and calcium mobilization, which ultimately results in lymphocyte migration. These downstream effects would enhance the completeness of the pathway.

3. **Complex Representation**: According to best practices for annotating complexes in GO-CAM, when the activity is shared by several proteins in a complex, both should be shown with their respective activities. The model correctly shows PGLYRP1 as having molecular adaptor activity and S100A4 as having chemoattractant activity, but could more explicitly represent their complex formation.

4. **Molecular Adaptor Annotation**: According to the guidelines for annotating molecular adaptor activity, the relation between the adaptor activity and the molecules it brings together should be 'has input'. The model could be improved by adding S100A4 and possibly CCR5/CXCR3 as inputs to PGLYRP1's adaptor activity.

5. **Biological Process Context**: The model could benefit from including a biological process context for each activity, such as "cell chemotaxis" (GO:0060326) or "lymphocyte chemotaxis" (GO:0048247).

## Recommended Revisions

1. Change the molecular function of CXCR3 from "C-C chemokine receptor activity" (GO:0016493) to "C-X-C chemokine receptor activity" (GO:0016494).

2. Add downstream activities that occur after receptor activation, including G-protein signaling, calcium mobilization, and ultimately cell migration.

3. Add "has input" relationships from PGLYRP1's adaptor activity to S100A4 to better represent how the adaptor brings molecules together.

4. Add biological process contexts for each activity, specifically linking them to "lymphocyte chemotaxis" (GO:0048247) or similar processes.

5. Consider adding additional information about the specificity of the receptor binding, as the literature indicates the Tag7-Mts1 complex has higher affinity for CCR5 than CXCR3.

## Summary

The GO-CAM model gomodel:5fce9b7300001616 successfully captures a novel chemotactic pathway involving the PGLYRP1-S100A4 complex and its activation of CCR5 and CXCR3 receptors. The model is well-supported by published evidence and correctly represents the core signaling relationships. With a few refinements, particularly in the accuracy of molecular function assignments and the addition of downstream signaling events, this model could provide an even more complete representation of this important pathway in immune cell migration.
