Based on my comprehensive review of the GO-CAM model gomodel:61f34dd300000863 and the relevant literature and protein information, I'll now provide my assessment of this model.

# GO-CAM Model Review for gomodel:61f34dd300000863

## Model Overview
This GO-CAM model titled "PKM2 acetylation by EP300 and deacetylation by SIRT6 leading to conversion into a protein kinase (Human)" represents a molecular pathway involving the pyruvate kinase M2 isoform (PKM2) and its regulation through acetylation and deacetylation, affecting its localization and function.

## Model Structure and Content

The model describes:
1. PKM2 (P14618-1) with multiple activities:
   - Pyruvate kinase activity (GO:0004743) in the cytoplasm
   - Histone H3T11 kinase activity (GO:0035402) in the nucleus
   - Protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) in the nucleus

2. EP300 (Q09472) with peptide-lysine-N-acetyltransferase activity (GO:0061733)

3. SIRT6 (Q8N6T7) with NAD-dependent protein lysine deacetylase activity (GO:0034979)

4. XPO4 (Q9C0E2) with nuclear export signal receptor activity (GO:0005049)

5. RAN (P62826) with G protein activity (GO:0003925)

The model depicts regulatory relationships showing how PKM2 acetylation by EP300 promotes its nuclear retention and function as a protein kinase, while deacetylation by SIRT6 promotes its export from the nucleus via XPO4, returning it to its cytoplasmic role in glycolysis.

## Scientific Accuracy

The model accurately represents the findings from the primary literature:

1. **PKM2 nuclear function**: The model correctly shows PKM2's dual role as a glycolytic enzyme in the cytoplasm and a protein kinase in the nucleus, as demonstrated in Yang et al. 2012 (PMID:22901803), where it phosphorylates histone H3 at T11.

2. **Acetylation by EP300**: The model correctly depicts EP300 acetylating PKM2 at K433, which promotes its nuclear localization and protein kinase activity (as shown in PMID:24120661).

3. **Deacetylation by SIRT6**: The model correctly shows SIRT6 deacetylating nuclear PKM2, which leads to nuclear export in an XPO4-dependent manner (as shown in Bhardwaj & Das 2016, PMID:26787900).

4. **Nuclear export mechanism**: The model appropriately includes XPO4 and RAN in the protein export pathway from the nucleus.

## GO-CAM Modeling Standards Assessment

### Strengths:
1. **Appropriate molecular functions**: The model uses the correct molecular functions for each protein.

2. **Correct cellular locations**: The model properly specifies the subcellular locations where activities occur (nucleus vs. cytoplasm).

3. **Causal relationships**: The model correctly uses RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) and RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) to show the regulatory relationships between activities.

4. **Comprehensive representation**: The model captures the bidirectional regulation of PKM2 location and function.

### Areas for improvement:

1. **Complex representation**: While the model shows the individual proteins correctly, there's no representation of any complexes that might form during these processes, such as PKM2-EP300 or PKM2-SIRT6 complexes that would likely exist during the acetylation/deacetylation processes.

2. **Missing details on phosphorylation targets**: While the model includes PKM2's kinase activities, it doesn't specifically indicate what proteins other than histone H3 might be phosphorylated by nuclear PKM2.

3. **Missing connection to biological outcomes**: The model doesn't connect these molecular activities to higher-level biological processes like gene expression changes or cancer-related phenotypes that are mentioned in the literature.

## Evidence Assessment

The model is well-supported by the cited literature:
- PMID:22901803 provides evidence for the H3T11 kinase activity
- PMID:24120661 provides evidence for the K433 acetylation by EP300
- PMID:26787900 provides evidence for SIRT6-mediated deacetylation and nuclear export
- PMID:10944119 provides evidence for XPO4 function in nuclear export

All causal relationships in the model have appropriate evidence codes and citations.

## Conclusion

This GO-CAM model is scientifically accurate and follows most GO-CAM best practices. It successfully represents the dynamic regulation of PKM2 localization and function through post-translational modification. The model effectively depicts how acetylation by EP300 promotes PKM2's nuclear retention and function as a protein kinase, while deacetylation by SIRT6 promotes its export back to the cytoplasm through XPO4, restoring its glycolytic function.

### Minor suggestions for improvement:
1. Consider incorporating protein complexes where appropriate
2. Add connections to broader biological outcomes
3. Include additional targets of PKM2 kinase activity if supported by evidence

Overall, this is a well-constructed GO-CAM model that accurately represents the current understanding of PKM2 regulation as described in the scientific literature.
