# Review of GO-CAM Model: TBK1 activation via TRAF3 autoubiquitination (Human)

## Model ID: [gomodel:5f46c3b700001407](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:5f46c3b700001407)

### Overview
This model represents the signaling pathway leading to TBK1 activation through TRAF3 autoubiquitination in human cells. It focuses on positive regulation of type I interferon production (GO:0032481), which is a critical process in innate immune responses to viral and bacterial infections.

### Model Structure

The model consists of 7 activities connected through causal relationships:

1. **TICAM2 (UniProtKB:Q86XR7)** - Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) occurring in endosome (GO:0005768)
2. **TICAM1 (UniProtKB:Q8IUC6)** - Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) occurring in endosome (GO:0005768)
3. **TRAF3 (UniProtKB:Q13114)** - Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) occurring in endosome (GO:0005768)
4. **MAVS (UniProtKB:Q7Z434)** - Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) occurring in mitochondrion (GO:0005739)
5. **TRAF3IP3 (UniProtKB:Q9Y228)** - Molecular adaptor activity (GO:0060090) occurring in mitochondrion (GO:0005739)
6. **TRAF3 (UniProtKB:Q13114)** - Ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630) occurring in mitochondrion (GO:0005739)
7. **TBK1 (UniProtKB:Q9UHD2)** - Protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO:0004674) occurring in cytoplasm (GO:0005737)

### Causal Flow Analysis

The causal flow in this model follows two main pathways:

1. **Endosomal pathway**: TICAM2 → TICAM1 → TRAF3 (endosomal) → TBK1
2. **Mitochondrial pathway**: MAVS → TRAF3IP3 → TRAF3 (mitochondrial) → TBK1

Both pathways converge on TBK1 activation, which leads to type I interferon production. The causal connections use RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates), indicating direct positive regulation.

### Scientific Accuracy Assessment

Based on the published literature provided (PMID:19898473 and PMID:14703513), the model appears scientifically accurate. The papers describe:

1. TRAF3's critical role in type I interferon responses
2. The importance of TRAF3 ubiquitination in regulating IFN production
3. TBK1's function as a protein serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates IRF3
4. The involvement of adaptor proteins like TICAM1/TICAM2 (also known as TRIF/TRAM) in engaging TRAF3
5. MAVS as a mitochondrial adaptor for TRAF3 in virus-induced signaling

### Adherence to GO-CAM Best Practices

Overall, the model follows GO-CAM best practices:

1. **Molecular adaptor annotation**: The model correctly represents molecular adaptor activities (GO:0060090) for TICAM1, TICAM2, MAVS, and TRAF3IP3. According to guidelines, these adaptors should use "directly positively regulates" (RO:0002629) relations to downstream activities, which is correctly implemented.

2. **E3 ubiquitin ligase representation**: TRAF3 is appropriately annotated with ubiquitin protein ligase activity (GO:0061630). The guidelines indicate E3 ligases should be connected to downstream processes they regulate.

3. **Cellular component annotation**: Each activity is correctly annotated with its cellular location (endosome, mitochondrion, or cytoplasm).

4. **Biological process annotation**: All activities are properly connected to their biological process, "positive regulation of type I interferon production" (GO:0032481).

5. **Evidence annotation**: Each activity is supported by experimental evidence (ECO:0000314 - direct assay evidence) with appropriate PMID references.

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Add inputs to molecular adaptors**: According to the guidelines, molecular adaptors should have inputs specified (the molecules they bring together). The current model doesn't specify inputs for any of the adaptor proteins.

2. **Clarify TRAF3 autoubiquitination**: The title mentions TRAF3 autoubiquitination, but this is not explicitly modeled. The model could more clearly show that TRAF3 ubiquitin ligase activity is self-directed, perhaps by adding TRAF3 as an input to its own activity.

3. **Include IRF3 activation**: Given that TBK1 ultimately phosphorylates and activates IRF3 leading to IFN production (as shown in PMID:14703513), the model could be extended to include this final step in the pathway.

4. **Distinguish K63 vs K48 ubiquitination**: The paper (PMID:19898473) discusses distinct modes of TRAF3 ubiquitination (K63-linked for the IFN pathway vs. K48-linked for degradation). This distinction could be made clearer in the model.

### Conclusion

GO-CAM model [gomodel:5f46c3b700001407](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:5f46c3b700001407) accurately represents the signaling pathway for TBK1 activation via TRAF3 autoubiquitination. It correctly implements GO-CAM best practices for molecular adaptor and E3 ligase annotation. The model effectively captures two distinct pathways (endosomal and mitochondrial) leading to TBK1 activation in type I interferon production. With minor enhancements to specify inputs for adaptors and more explicitly model TRAF3 autoubiquitination, this would be an exemplary representation of this signaling pathway.
