I need to review a GO-CAM model, but you haven't provided a specific model ID. The `lookup_gocam` tool requires a model ID in the format of a GO model identifier or UUID.

Could you please provide the specific model ID you'd like me to review? This would typically be in a format like "go.model:12345" or a UUID.
