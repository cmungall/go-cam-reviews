# GO-CAM Model Review: gomodel:5fa76ad400000018 "AMP catabolic process 2 (Mouse)"

## Overview

This model ([gomodel:5fa76ad400000018](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:5fa76ad400000018)) describes the AMP catabolic process in mouse, focusing on the pathway components involved in AMP metabolism and transport. The model involves several key proteins:

1. Nt5e (CD73, 5'-nucleotidase) - MGI:MGI:99782
2. Entpd1 (CD39, ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1) - MGI:MGI:102805
3. Slc29a1 (ENT1, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 1) - MGI:MGI:1927073
4. Slc29a2 (ENT2, equilibrative nucleoside transporter 2) - MGI:MGI:1345278
5. Ampd3 (AMP deaminase 3) - MGI:MGI:1096344

## Key Model Elements and Activities

The model includes the following activities:

1. **5'-nucleotidase activity (GO:0008253)** performed by Nt5e (CD73) - converts AMP to adenosine
2. **ADP phosphatase activity (GO:0043262)** performed by Entpd1 (CD39) - converts ADP to AMP
3. **AMP deaminase activity (GO:0003876)** performed by Ampd3 - involved in AMP catabolism
4. **Purine nucleoside transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015211)** performed by both Slc29a1 (ENT1) and Slc29a2 (ENT2)

The activities are connected through causal associations with the predicate "provides input for" (RO:0002413), describing a metabolic pathway where ADP is converted to AMP, which is then either transported or further metabolized.

## Evidence Assessment

The model is supported by multiple scientific publications, primarily:
- PMID:28746349 - Details AMP metabolism in erythrocytes, specifically discussing the roles of CD73, AMPD3, and nucleoside transporters
- PMID:28069792 - Referenced for evidence about Slc29a1 and Slc29a2 activity
- PMID:17502665 - Provides evidence for Entpd1 function
- PMID:20430891 - Supports evidence for Nt5e function

The literature strongly supports the molecular functions and biological processes represented in this model. PMID:28746349 in particular provides detailed information about the interplay between these enzymes in regulating the adenine nucleotide pool in erythrocytes.

## Model Correctness Assessment

### Biological Accuracy

The model accurately represents the AMP catabolic pathway according to the current scientific knowledge. Key points:

1. **Entpd1 (CD39)** correctly shown hydrolyzing ADP to AMP on the external side of the plasma membrane
2. **Nt5e (CD73)** correctly shown hydrolyzing AMP to adenosine on the external side of the plasma membrane
3. **Nucleoside transporters** (Slc29a1/ENT1 and Slc29a2/ENT2) correctly shown transporting nucleosides
4. **Ampd3** correctly shown as involved in intracellular AMP catabolism

The UniProt entries confirm the molecular functions assigned to each protein in the model.

### GO-CAM Standards Compliance

The model follows GO-CAM best practices:

1. Activities are connected through appropriate causal associations
2. Molecular functions are correctly associated with gene products
3. Input and output molecules are properly specified
4. Cellular locations are accurately annotated
5. Biological processes are appropriately associated with activities

### Areas for Potential Improvement

1. **Subcellular Localization**: While the model includes some localization information (e.g., CD73 at GO:0009897 "external side of plasma membrane"), some additional specificity might be beneficial for Ampd3, which is shown to be in cytosol (
