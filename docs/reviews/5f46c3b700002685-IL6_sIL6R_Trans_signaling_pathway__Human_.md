Based on my review of the model and supporting information, I'll now provide a comprehensive review of gomodel:5f46c3b700002685 "IL6:sIL6R Trans-signaling pathway (Human)".

# Review of GO-CAM Model: IL6:sIL6R Trans-signaling pathway (Human)

## Model Summary

**Model ID**: [gomodel:5f46c3b700002685](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:5f46c3b700002685)  
**Species**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)  
**Status**: Production  
**Title**: IL6:sIL6R Trans-signaling pathway (Human)

This model represents the interleukin-6 (IL6) trans-signaling pathway in humans, focusing on the interaction between IL6, the soluble IL6 receptor (sIL6R), and the signal transducer glycoprotein 130 (gp130/IL6ST). The model captures the key molecular events in this signaling pathway, from ligand-receptor binding to downstream activation of JAK/STAT signaling, as well as negative regulation by SOCS3.

## Model Structure and Accuracy

### Pathway Representation

The model correctly captures the main components of IL6 trans-signaling:

1. **IL6 cytokine activity**: IL6 (UniProtKB:P05231) with its cytokine activity (GO:0005125) occurring in extracellular space (GO:0005615), which positively regulates soluble IL6R.

2. **Soluble IL6R activity**: IL6R (UniProtKB:P08887-2, isoform 2 representing the soluble form) with cytokine receptor activity (GO:0004896) occurring in extracellular space (GO:0005615), which positively regulates IL6ST/gp130.

3. **IL6ST/gp130 activity**: IL6ST (UniProtKB:P40189) with protein tyrosine kinase activator activity (GO:0030296) occurring at the plasma membrane (GO:0005886), which positively regulates JAK1 kinase activity.

4. **JAK1 kinase activity**: JAK1 (UniProtKB:P23458) with protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713) occurring at the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane (GO:0009898), which positively regulates STAT3 activity.

5. **STAT3 activity**: STAT3 (UniProtKB:P40763) with DNA-binding transcription factor activity (GO:0003700) occurring in the nucleus (GO:0005634).

6. **Negative regulation by SOCS3**: SOCS3 (UniProtKB:O14543) with protein kinase inhibitor activity (GO:0004860) occurring at the cytoplasmic side of plasma membrane (GO:0009898), which negatively regulates JAK1 activity.

### Scientific Accuracy

The model is scientifically accurate based on current knowledge of IL6 signaling:

1. **Trans-signaling mechanism**: The model correctly represents IL6 trans-signaling where IL6 first forms a complex with soluble IL6R, and this complex then engages gp130/IL6ST to initiate signaling. This is supported by the PMID:12829785 reference which describes the hexameric structure of this complex.

2. **Signaling cascade**: The downstream activation of JAK1 and subsequently STAT3 is accurately represented, which is the canonical signaling pathway activated by IL6.

3. **Negative feedback**: The negative regulation by SOCS3 of JAK1 kinase represents an essential feedback mechanism for controlling IL6 signaling, referenced by PMID:9727029.

4. **Biological process annotations**: All activities are appropriately placed within their respective biological processes - IL6-mediated signaling pathway (GO:0070102) for the cytokine and receptors, and JAK-STAT cascade (GO:0007259) for the downstream components.

### Relationship to Literature

The model is well-supported by the scientific literature:

- The structure of the IL6/IL6R/IL6ST complex as described in PMID:12829785 (Boulanger et al., 2003) is correctly represented in
