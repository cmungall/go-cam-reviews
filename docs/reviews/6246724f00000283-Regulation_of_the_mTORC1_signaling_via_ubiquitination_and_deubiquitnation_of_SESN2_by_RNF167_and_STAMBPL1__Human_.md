Based on my review of the GO-CAM model and the reference papers, I can now provide a comprehensive review of model [gomodel:6246724f00000283](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6246724f00000283) "Regulation of the mTORC1 signaling via ubiquitination and deubiquitnation of SESN2 by RNF167 and STAMBPL1 (Human)":

# GO-CAM Model Review: gomodel:6246724f00000283

## General Assessment

This model represents the regulation of mTORC1 signaling through the ubiquitination and deubiquitination of SESN2 (Sestrin2) by RNF167 and STAMBPL1 in humans. The model is based on multiple primary literature references, particularly PMID:[35114100](https://bioregistry.io/pubmed:35114100), PMID:[26586190](https://bioregistry.io/pubmed:26586190), and PMID:[36528027](https://bioregistry.io/pubmed:36528027).

## Biological Content Accuracy

The model accurately represents the key molecular functions and relationships described in the literature:

1. **SESN2 Function**: The model correctly shows SESN2 ([UniProtKB:P58004](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:P58004)) acting as a protein with sequestering activity ([GO:0140311](https://bioregistry.io/go:0140311)), which is consistent with its established role as a leucine sensor that negatively regulates mTORC1 signaling when active. As described in PMID:26586190, SESN2 detects leucine through a specific binding pocket, and when not bound to leucine, it interacts with GATOR2 to inhibit mTORC1 signaling.

2. **Regulatory Mechanisms**: The model shows:
   - RNF167 ([UniProtKB:Q9H6Y7](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q9H6Y7)) acting with ubiquitin-protein transferase activity, mediating K63-linked ubiquitination
   - STAMBPL1 ([UniProtKB:Q96FJ0](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q96FJ0)) with K63-linked deubiquitinase activity
   - WDR24 ([UniProtKB:Q96S15](https://bioregistry.io/uniprot:Q96S15)) with ubiquitin protein ligase activity mediating K6-linked ubiquitination

3. **Causal Relationships**: The model correctly represents:
   - RNF167 directly positively regulates SESN2 activity
   - STAMBPL1 directly negatively regulates SESN2 activity
   - SESN2 directly negatively regulates WDR24, which is part of the GATOR2 complex

## Compliance with GO-CAM Best Practices

The model generally follows GO-CAM best practices:

1. **Appropriate Annotation of Complexes**: The model correctly represents the case where individual proteins carry specific molecular activities, following the guidance in the "How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM" document.

2. **Protein Sequestering Activity**: The model appropriately uses protein sequestering activity ([GO:0140311](https://bioregistry.io/go:0140311)) for SESN2, which is consistent with the "Protein sequestering activity" guidelines. SESN2 sequesters components of the GATOR2 complex (though this relationship could be more explicitly shown with a "has input" relation).

3. **Appropriate Regulation Relations**: The model uses the correct causal relation predicates:
   - RO:0002629 (directly positively regulates) for direct positive regulation
   - RO:0002630 (directly negatively regulates) for direct negative regulation

4. **Cellular Locations**: The model appropriately indicates the cellular components in which activities occur, with appropriate evidence:
   - Lysosomal membrane ([GO:0005765](https://bioregistry.io/go:0005765)) for RNF167 and WDR24
   - Cytoplasm ([GO:0005737](https://bioregistry.io/go:0005737)) for SESN2

## Areas for Improvement

1. **Additional Context Needed**: The model would benefit from explicitly showing SESN2's leucine binding activity ([GO:0070728](https://bioregistry.io/go:0070728)) in relation to its sequestering activity. While the model shows SESN2 with leucine binding activity, the relationship between this activity and its sequestering function could be made clearer with appropriate causal relations.

2. **Input/Output Relationships**: The model could be improved by explicitly showing SESN2's "has input" relationship with its target(s) in the GATOR2 complex, as recommended in the protein sequestering activity guidelines.

3. **Pathway Context**: The biological process context could be expanded to show how this regulatory mechanism fits into the broader leucine sensing and mTORC1 regulatory pathway, possibly by including additional upstream or downstream activities.

4. **Evidence Support**: While the model cites appropriate references, the connections between leucine binding and SESN2's regulatory activities could be strengthened with additional evidence codes or references.

## Conclusion

Overall, this GO-CAM model ([gomodel:6246724f00000283](https://bioregistry.io/go.model:6246724f00000283)) is scientifically accurate and generally follows GO-CAM best practices. It correctly represents the regulatory mechanisms controlling mTORC1 signaling through SESN2, RNF167, and STAMBPL1. With some minor enhancements to explicitly show the relationships between leucine binding and SESN2's regulatory activity, and to provide additional pathway context, the model would more completely represent the biological system described in the literature.

The model is supported by high-quality evidence from peer-reviewed publications and appropriately captures the roles of key proteins in this regulatory pathway.
