I need a specific GO-CAM model ID to review. The parameter you provided `{model.id}` appears to be a placeholder rather than an actual model ID.

GO-CAM model IDs typically follow a format like "gomodel:12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012" or sometimes just the UUID portion "12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012".

Could you please provide a valid GO-CAM model ID that you would like me to review?
