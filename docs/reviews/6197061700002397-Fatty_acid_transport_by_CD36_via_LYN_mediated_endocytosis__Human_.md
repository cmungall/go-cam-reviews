# Review of GO-CAM Model: 6197061700002397

## Basic Information

- **Title**: Fatty acid transport by CD36 via LYN-mediated endocytosis (Human)
- **Taxon**: Human (NCBITaxon:9606)
- **Status**: production

## Overview

This model describes the molecular mechanism of fatty acid transport by CD36 through a LYN-mediated endocytosis pathway in humans. The model includes four activities involving four different proteins (CD36, LYN, ZDHHC5, and LYPLA1) that work together to facilitate fatty acid transport.

## Molecular Activities in the Model

The model contains four main activities:

1. **LYPLA1/APT1 (UniProtKB:O75608)** - palmitoyl-(protein) hydrolase activity (GO:0008474)
   - Occurs in: plasma membrane (GO:0005886)
   - Part of: fatty acid transport (GO:0015908)
   - Evidence: ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence used in manual assertion) from PMID:32958780

2. **CD36 (UniProtKB:P16671)** - cargo receptor activity (GO:0038024)
   - Occurs in: plasma membrane (GO:0005886)
   - Part of: fatty acid transport (GO:0015908)
   - Evidence: ECO:0000314 from PMID:32958780
   - Causally associated with: LYN protein tyrosine kinase activity (RO:0002629 - directly positively regulates)

3. **LYN (UniProtKB:P07948)** - protein tyrosine kinase activity (GO:0004713)
   - Occurs in: plasma membrane (GO:0005886)
   - Part of: fatty acid transport (GO:0015908)
   - Evidence: ECO:0000314 from PMID:32958780
   - Causally associated with: ZDHHC5 palmitoyltransferase activity (RO:0002630 - directly negatively regulates)

4. **ZDHHC5 (UniProtKB:Q9C0B5)** - palmitoyltransferase activity (GO:0016409)
   - Occurs in: plasma membrane (GO:0005886)
   - Part of: positive regulation of protein localization to plasma membrane (GO:1903078)
   - Evidence: ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence used in manual assertion) from PMID:31649195
   - Causally associated with: LYPLA1/APT1 palmitoyl-(protein) hydrolase activity (RO:0002418 - provides input for)

## Causal Flow

The causal flow in this model is:
1. CD36 directly positively regulates LYN
2. LYN directly negatively regulates ZDHHC5
3. ZDHHC5 provides input for LYPLA1/APT1

## Biological Context

This model represents the mechanism of fatty acid uptake by CD36 through dynamic palmitoylation-regulated endocytosis, as described in the cited primary research paper (PMID:32958780). According to this paper:

1. CD36 acts as a receptor for fatty acids at the plasma membrane
2. When fatty acids bind to CD36, it activates LYN kinase
3. LYN phosphorylates ZDHHC5 at Tyr91, which inactivates ZDHHC5
4. ZDHHC5 inactivation leads to depalmitoylation of CD36 by APT1 (LYPLA1)
5. Depalmitoylated CD36 undergoes endocytosis, bringing fatty acids into the cell

## Evidence Quality

All molecular activities in the model are supported by experimental evidence from published literature:
- Primary reference is PMID:32958780, which directly demonstrates the mechanisms
- Additional evidence from PMID:22022213 for CD36 plasma membrane localization
- Evidence for ZDHHC5's role in protein localization from PMID:31649195

The evidence codes used are appropriate:
- ECO:0000314 (direct assay evidence) for most assertions
- ECO:0000315 (mutant phenotype evidence) for ZDHHC5's role in plasma membrane localization

## Review of Causal Relations

The causal relationships in this model are well-supported by the primary literature and use appropriate relation ontology terms:

1. CD36 → LYN (RO:0002629 "directly positively regulates"): Correct relation as CD36 binding to fatty acids directly activates LYN kinase
2. LYN → ZDHHC5 (RO:0002630 "directly negatively regulates"): Appropriate relation as LYN phosphorylation of ZDHHC5 at Tyr91 inhibits its activity
3. ZDHHC5 → LYPLA1 (RO:0002418 "provides input for"): Correct relation as ZDHHC5 inactivation enables LYPLA1 to depalmitoylate CD36

## Review of UniProt Entries

I've examined the UniProt entries for all proteins in the model:

1. **CD36 (P16671)**: Correctly identified as a fatty acid transporter located in plasma membrane with multiple palmitoylation sites
2. **LYN (P07948)**: Correctly identified as a tyrosine-protein kinase with a role in signal transduction
3. **ZDHHC5 (Q9C0B5)**: Correctly identified as a palmitoyltransferase with Tyr91 as a phosphorylation site
4. **LYPLA1 (O75608)**: Correctly identified as a palmitoyl-(protein) hydrolase with activity on palmitoylated proteins

## Consistency with GO-CAM Best Practices

Regarding complexes (per "How to annotate complexes in GO-CAM" document), this model follows best practices by:
1. Representing each protein with its specific molecular function when known
2. Using appropriate causal relationships between activities
3. Correctly annotating cellular components for each protein

## Strengths of the Model

1. Well-supported by primary literature with appropriate evidence codes
2. Clearly represents the causal flow of fatty acid uptake mechanism
3. Correctly identifies all molecular activities and their cellular locations
4. Uses appropriate relation ontology terms for causal connections
5. Matches the biological knowledge described in the primary research paper

## Improvement Suggestions

1. **Minor suggestion**: The model could be expanded to include the downstream effects of CD36 endocytosis, such as the delivery of fatty acids to their intracellular destinations.

2. **Potential addition**: The model could include the role of CAV1 (Caveolin-1), as the primary paper mentions that CD36 is primarily localized in caveolae and requires CAV1 for internalization.

## Overall Assessment

This GO-CAM model accurately represents the current mechanistic understanding of CD36-mediated fatty acid uptake through dynamic palmitoylation-regulated endocytosis. The model is well-constructed, uses appropriate annotations, and is supported by strong experimental evidence from the literature. The causal relationships between the molecular activities are correctly represented, and the model provides a clear picture of this biological process.

The model is consistent with GO-CAM best practices and accurately represents the roles of the four key proteins (CD36, LYN, ZDHHC5, and LYPLA1) in fatty acid transport. I recommend acceptance of this model as it stands, with the possible minor additions suggested above if deemed appropriate by the curator.
